## What is flutter and what it isnâ€™t 

Flutter is a multi platform development framework with a focus on developer productivity

* Single code base can generate iOS, Android, web and even desktop(mac, windows, ubuntu) apps
* Excellent developer experience with hot-reload, debugging, logging, inspection capabilities
* Uses a high level, easy to learn language: [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
* Open source project backed by Google

### What flutter isn't

It is _**not an automation framework**_ but rather a full framework with excellent automated testing capabilities

### What is different about flutter

1. Native development

   * Default choice for millions of mobile developers
   * Code in Android Studio, Kotlin/Java for Android, Xcode, Swift/Objective-C for iOS
   * Need two(or more) different skillsets for each client
   * Two different code repositories, CI/CD tools, testing tools

1. [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
   * More matured code base which targets iOS and Android
   * Backed by facebook
   * Code in JavaScript
   * *Personal opinion:* Disjointed toolset and ecosystem lacks cohesion
2. Mobile web
   * Use same technology as main web site but rendered for mobile phones
   * Code in any language, web framework better use responsive layouts
   * Good option for some small applications
3. Xamarin/Cordova others
